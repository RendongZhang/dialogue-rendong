what planet to be a cosmotologist in an esthetician ?,8

no ma'am,6
thank you very much,5
is it asking me like { personname } ?,8
do i say it again or ?,8
did it not pick up ?,8
just hit the spacebar,9
i worked as a someone who used to work in maintenance back in 2016 and prior to that i was a childcare assistant for new hope academy,9
essentially i would help clean bathrooms and trash cans and essentially move things around that needed to be moved around circulate items such as toilet paper and soap and whatnot and for the childcare assistant i would help children after daycare for my school,9
i would say that my skills are pretty basic for the most part but i think they are pretty exceptional not exactly advanced per se but um ? i could still learn from a bit more,10
i 've been using word processing software for approximately maybe six years now i 'd say about six years,9
uh,0
define spreadsheet,9
i suppose working with spreadsheets for about 15 hours would benefit my schedule,11
i helped other people in college with an assignment and essentially i think i did a pretty good job it was a team bonding thing and i 'd say that i did a pretty good job at it not i do n't mean to gosh but,9
most enjoyed it in school well that 's a difficult question because there 's a lot of areas in school that i find interesting history was one of my big ones i 'd also have to say that literature and grammar was important to me spelling and whatnot reading um ? i was not very good at math math is one of my unfortunate flaws i 'm not very good at math but everything else i seem to be pretty much ok with,9
um ?,0
yeah i again i 'm not very good at math,12
but i do n't know,1
i guess there are some interesting things about it that help me to understand,1
more about life situations i suppose,1
in most of my classes surprisingly i got a 's and b 's all but in the math section in the math section i had uh these at the most i was never really good at it but i got through somehow,9
i was in homec for awhile and it was pretty interesting um ? some other classes may include taking german i took german for a little while it did n't really last long but it helped some i do know some,9
i 'd say my greatest personal attribute would be helpfulness and maybe kindness i always try to be as kind as i can to other people to help them get what they need but i 'm also persistent in trying to pursue um ? what it is that i want out of a job ? and i can tell this would be a great thing to put my strengths towards,9
well for one thing my people skills sometimes are n't as great as i 'd like them to be and i think that maybe through this i could experience um ? more openness about my condition and maybe perhaps find i do n't know just something just hopefully this job if i do get it will be beneficial towards my situation,10
um ? let 's see definitely not superman that one 's taken um ? that 's a good question actually i do n't know what my name would be as a superhero uh for superpower though i 'd guess maybe time travel that would be a pretty cool power to have go back in time and fix things before they happen um ? and my arch nemesis is algebra man,9
best advice from a mentor that i 've ever received that 's also really really big question um ? 46 times stand up when it fall 7 times stand up eight was probably one of the best words of advice that i 've received before,9
my ideal work environment is relaxed and laid back but also i 'd say laid back but at the same time also nurturing and nurturing environment when and also understanding environment would probably be more beneficial towards someone like me,9
i had to make a difficult decision i think when i was working as a childcare assistant i had to it was a really rushed decision but a child was in need of assistance after they had um ? yeah i do n't think i want to go through with the rest of that,10
um ? i did get into i did have to get out of my comfort zone this one time and sometimes it can be overwhelming but sometimes it needs to be done to see how much what my limit is in a work environment ? um ? no stories come to mind at the moment but i 'd have to say that i have been to that place before and it 's not an easy rd to go down on when you have aspergers,9
um ? i suppose there was this one time where i had to work with another student who ? i guess we did n't see eye to eye exactly on everything so i was stuck mostly with the work i got through it but it was pretty stressful i just made sure that i told them exactly what was going on and made sure that they knew exactly what ? my plans were for this assignment and then just told them straight up what needed to happen ?,9
i think i remember they switched programs this one time in another class that i took and it was difficult getting used to so i had to learn the thing learn the the i had to learn the program very quickly and it was n't something that was exactly used to because i 'm used to windows but we had to adapt and so i did,10
i think a diverse group i had to work with a diverse group in i think the first college class that i ever went to it was interesting to say the least but at the same time it was also kind of difficult because we were n't on the same page with each other um ? but i worked around it and got through it,10
yes i do i do n't exactly have a. well it 's more of a permit actually um ? but i guess legally you could say that i do have a drivers license it 's more of a permit though,12
what exactly ?,8
sg-1 { personname } net,9

i think i 'm doing well,10
superman my superpower would be flying and my arch nemesis would probably be no one,9

{ personname },9

i never managed to help,6
by just being myself,9
'cause we were working on the team,9
no,6
yes,11
yes yes,11
i worked as a dishwasher at cracker barrel,9
yes i 've used microsoft word and google docs,12
yes i have used google sheets and microsoft excel,12
i worked on an engineering design project where i helped design a wind turbine with a group of other students and i learn leadership skills by helping organize our meetings and helping encourage them to work hard and i also learn technical skills because i help do the transmission for the wind turbine,9
math,9
i got mostly a 's in my classes,9
yes i put icipe tyddyn science olympiad in high school and in college i 've been participating in the em rads program which is a research program,12
i 'm poster viewing,9
probably my communication skills,9
i 'm performing alright i think,10
my name is super cat and my superpower is being able to see through everything and my archnemesis is evil cat,9
mypillow mentor in told me that no matter what you should n't worry about success or failure you should just try hard to do the best you can,9
my ideal work environment is somewhere well i can succeed while still being around other people and well i can focus without being nervous,9
or one time ? in when i was at cracker barrel as a dishwasher i had to decide otherwise i would stand up to one of my coworkers who was n't being very respectable of me so that was difficult,9
i would respectfully make sure that the person who you 're talking to has the correct revenue man blue i would say wait are you sure that was the correct ave number ? i thought it was this other number,9
i had to manage change when i went from high school to college because when you go from high school to college you living in a dorm and you not at home anymore and the academics get more difficult and there 's more pressure and i handled it just by trying hood and making sure i i was balanced and studied a lot but at the same time felt found time for self care,9
i work with a diverse group in my classes like for example my chemical engineering class with i work with people from lots of different backgrounds and that that helps so we have more ideas 'cause they get ? people have different ideas when they come from different backgrounds,9
yes i do have a drivers license,11
yes how do you ? keep everyone encouraged to do the best on the job,8

i read about us a solid 810 not really like a super genius idea but yeah solid 8 out of 10,9
really all my life 'cause i always but i had like a project or something always used it so about 13 years maybe,9
like i said before i am experience with microsoft excel,9
i say like social studies in history,9
i do n't know,1
i guess interest me,1
how is the ? that was a pretty average soon as about be sometimes sometimes they house around that area so 3.0,9
not as much as i liked i tried to join the tennis team but it closed down so i really do n't have the opportunity,7
my greatest personal attribute,9
that 's a really tough on,9
an element,9
i mean i guess my curiosity and my eagerness to learn new things that interest me,10
alright i 'll call it but no,0
probably my motivation i said that needs to be improved a lot,9
uh should father superhero i think i just wrote my actual name you know { personname } ? i really need a superhero name my power i 'll clabby indestructible 'cause that 's cool marge nemesis i do n't know if i was some dictator in the country,10
do n't give up it always gets better in the end and if you do n't get better then it 's not the end,9
i 'm i do it 's like lax relax but it 's also like work intensive where there 's a lot of work but it did n't feel like it was a lot of work friendly coworkers is also a huge plus,9
i. i 'm sorry i ca n't really think of any difficult decisions i have to make over the top of my head,2
probably at school because i want to teach always tries to make me do like projects other people rather be alone 'cause 'cause i ca n't rely on anyone so what i do i just i just suck it up,9
i would say ma'am i think you misread the document 'cause here the real numbers yeah,9
i want to,9
at the move i handled it i have a fairly well,9
or how are the people like ?,8
what benefits am i going to be getting ? what ? what 's your department ?,8
will i be getting free ? like health insurance,8
my name is { personname },9
yes,11
yes,11
yes,11
i do n't know,1
i do n't know yet,1
i worked on,9
i worked on art drawing coloring and other stuff,9
maybe math ?,9
because of addition and subtraction,9
maybe asian bees ? maybe a 's and b 's,1
i do n't know,1
i do n't know,1
i do n't know it yet,1
maybe getting good grades ?,1
i do n't know,1
i do n't know,1
maybe nothing,1
i do n't know,1
i do n't know,1
i do not know it yet,1
maybe in the morning ?,1
yes,11
um no,6
that sounds great thanks,9
so what i 've done before is it was in an office setting and kind of sort of what i had to do was just organizational stuff getting you select out his office things works and it was it was the same type of stuff as this learn stuff works too that 's fun i think it 's helpful,9
yes i 've been using microsoft word as well as google sheets,12
i 'm not like amazing superstar but i can do it fine at sam pretty proficient in most of the the things that it does,9
i 've been using it for several years think mercy since like i had to start writing papers think middle school times i 've been using it since then and i have n't really stopped { personname } is doing similar stuff with me,9
i 'd say i 'm pretty proficient i know how they work sort of but i 'm not proficient with that same word,9
i think i 've been using that for at least five years but pretty infrequently,9
um from my prior work experience i used to spend probably maybe a solid like 10 hours a week doing that that was n't online did though i did several things,9
yeah i can do that,11
so one,9
um the project that i did was filling out peoples names and reaching out to people for a fund raising event for this nonprofit that worked for anyways just entering a bunch of names into there and organizing it based on address phone like i respect if they are all of that stuff and it was it was pretty time consuming but i 'd say it was worth it,9
generally i got good grades like mostly asian bees i think my high school experience i got about 3.5 gpa,9
i did a few sports in school,9
i think my greatest personal attribute is my willingness my commitment to get a job done as well as loyalty and humility i will take whatever does so like do something for a certain objective and i usually try not to make a big deal out of things,10
i 'd say i did for me pretty well,10
that 's a good question i think my name i 'm not really sure what my name would be i think it might be ice mankind because i can get some flash power and also shoot i some people and that would be my main power as well as having cave and stuff in my iceman my enemy would be a fire breathing demon goddess is used to destroy everything that i like,9
that 's a good one i think probably the best advice is just do n't give up always believe that things will workout and that things will workout and acting that is true in my own life and try to believe it and try to apply it to everything i do,9
i think it 's good for me because sometimes if i get like dejected or like i feel like i ca n't do it it 's just remembering that this all this is only like my favorite things will eventually be past this is just get through this and you 'll be done and will be so so worth it once you get it done,10
hey my ideal work environment is pretty i 'd say relax not to like uptight but also one where people i can give up constructive criticism and pointers that can help you be the best version of yourself you can be and that you can ultimately perform at the best level that you need to so one that builds up on it does n't break you down,9
i think maybe definitely on choosing where to go to school ? i had desires to do one thing but another opportunity seemed better and excited to pursue that opportunity and when it was hard to leave the other opportunities to close that door i knew that no one that sound itself to me is going to be the best and so even though it 's hard to we 're going to do that i knew that there would be better things waiting ahead,9
i think sometimes when i 'm out of my comfort zone it 's in new environments with new people is i do n't actually adapt to new environments very well and one thing that i have done back usually working out like getting acclimated slowly i 'll feel like i really feel like i do n't have to or i should n't i really feel like i should n't have to rush into everything in order to enjoy myself and eventually everything will workout and i 'll be fine,9
i think i would probably let him know that he 's made the mistake and then try and maybe write some correction,9
{ personname },9
yes,11
i do,9
yes i 've used microsoft word and microsoft powerpoint,11
i have not worked on any sort of projects recently,9
communication theory,9

there was one time when ? an involve someone who wanted a day off and asked me to cover and i was upset at first about it but then i apologized and they were able to still get their day off,9
usually when it comes to my mom getting a new car i was able to handle it by writing it for a bit,9
there was one time where i was doing a project with these two people then we were able to get along because we were able to talk about regular stuff,9
we were because we were able to talk about our research and us and about our regular lives,10

i participated in the marching band the concert band and i participated in the play,9
i 'm very hard working,9
not tearable,9
i do n't know what my super name my superhero name would be but my superpower would probably be a shapeshifting and my arch nemesis would probably be someone who like combats that pretty well so like someone is very smart and can like constrict me and make me not thank you i do n't know what my superhero name would be but my superpower would be shapeshifting and my arch nemesis would probably have to be someone who would be able to constrict me from doing my thing,1
probably i believe in you do n't give up,9
it just reminds me that people do believe in me and care about me and that they want to see me succeed,9
not something hectic but there 's not too little work,9
i had multiple assignments due back to back to back on the same day and i had to prioritize the assignments over each other and i. managed care at all i had multiple assignments due back to back to back on the same day and i had to figure out which assignments to do first,9
i i was in a public setting and i did n't want to be there anymore because they were talking about topics i did n't want to talk about so i just like came up with an excuse that i had to go to the bathroom and i just left and did not go back,9
i would calmly correct you in a way that would n't be i would calmly correct you in a way that would not come off as disrespectful,9
i was a section leader for my marching band for my section the french horns and the other section leaders kept bringing i was the section leader for the french horns in my marching band and the other section leaders kept bringing me over to help them with their sections and they did that because i was very good at like handling other people and keeping them like in line suppose,9
now we in the end we got to where we were supposed to be for the marching band set up the show and that was really good yeah in the end we got to where we needed to be in the marching band show and it was all thanks to everyones like work ethic and we eventually got to a point in the marching band show where we were all very proud of it and it was all thanks to everyone to work ethic and time that they had put in,9
