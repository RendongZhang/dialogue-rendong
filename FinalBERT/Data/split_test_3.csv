i think maybe definitely on choosing where to go to school ? i had desires to do one thing but another opportunity seemed better and excited to pursue that opportunity and when it was hard to leave the other opportunities to close that door i knew that no one that sound itself to me is going to be the best and so even though it 's hard to we 're going to do that i knew that there would be better things waiting ahead,9
i think sometimes when i 'm out of my comfort zone it 's in new environments with new people is i do n't actually adapt to new environments very well and one thing that i have done back usually working out like getting acclimated slowly i 'll feel like i really feel like i do n't have to or i should n't i really feel like i should n't have to rush into everything in order to enjoy myself and eventually everything will workout and i 'll be fine,9
