mistake i would,9
i 'm here for the job interview,9
i used a microsoft,9
microsoft with numbers and words both,9
just hit the spacebar,9
i worked as a someone who used to work in maintenance back in 2016 and prior to that i was a childcare assistant for new hope academy,9
i helped other people in college with an assignment and essentially i think i did a pretty good job it was a team bonding thing and i 'd say that i did a pretty good job at it not i do n't mean to gosh but,9
yeah i again i 'm not very good at math,12
in most of my classes surprisingly i got a 's and b 's all but in the math section in the math section i had uh these at the most i was never really good at it but i got through somehow,9
i had to make a difficult decision i think when i was working as a childcare assistant i had to it was a really rushed decision but a child was in need of assistance after they had um ? yeah i do n't think i want to go through with the rest of that,10
um ? i did get into i did have to get out of my comfort zone this one time and sometimes it can be overwhelming but sometimes it needs to be done to see how much what my limit is in a work environment ? um ? no stories come to mind at the moment but i 'd have to say that i have been to that place before and it 's not an easy rd to go down on when you have aspergers,9
um ? i suppose there was this one time where i had to work with another student who ? i guess we did n't see eye to eye exactly on everything so i was stuck mostly with the work i got through it but it was pretty stressful i just made sure that i told them exactly what was going on and made sure that they knew exactly what ? my plans were for this assignment and then just told them straight up what needed to happen ?,9
i think a diverse group i had to work with a diverse group in i think the first college class that i ever went to it was interesting to say the least but at the same time it was also kind of difficult because we were n't on the same page with each other um ? but i worked around it and got through it,10
