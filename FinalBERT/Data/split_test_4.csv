yes ma'am,11

no ma'am i do n't,6
because numbers just are better for me and i in reading it 's just not my best subject,9
well i think i should be able to read more i should be able to learn about more computer work to be honest do work on getting better at it,10
because one second because it just helps me out with lots of things,9
it was really tough,9
is it asking me like { personname } ?,8
essentially i would help clean bathrooms and trash cans and essentially move things around that needed to be moved around circulate items such as toilet paper and soap and whatnot and for the childcare assistant i would help children after daycare for my school,9
i would say that my skills are pretty basic for the most part but i think they are pretty exceptional not exactly advanced per se but um ? i could still learn from a bit more,10
i suppose working with spreadsheets for about 15 hours would benefit my schedule,11
more about life situations i suppose,1
i 'd say my greatest personal attribute would be helpfulness and maybe kindness i always try to be as kind as i can to other people to help them get what they need but i 'm also persistent in trying to pursue um ? what it is that i want out of a job ? and i can tell this would be a great thing to put my strengths towards,9
um ? let 's see definitely not superman that one 's taken um ? that 's a good question actually i do n't know what my name would be as a superhero uh for superpower though i 'd guess maybe time travel that would be a pretty cool power to have go back in time and fix things before they happen um ? and my arch nemesis is algebra man,9
i think i remember they switched programs this one time in another class that i took and it was difficult getting used to so i had to learn the thing learn the the i had to learn the program very quickly and it was n't something that was exactly used to because i 'm used to windows but we had to adapt and so i did,10

i had to manage change when i went from high school to college because when you go from high school to college you living in a dorm and you not at home anymore and the academics get more difficult and there 's more pressure and i handled it just by trying hood and making sure i i was balanced and studied a lot but at the same time felt found time for self care,9
