 Is it asking me like {personName}?,query,3
Do I say it again or?,query,3
 Did it not pick up? ,query,3
My name is {personName}.,sno,3
 Just hit the spacebar.,sno,3
 I worked as a someone who used to work in maintenance back in 2016 and prior to that I was a childcare assistant for New Hope Academy.,sno,3
 Essentially  I would help clean bathrooms and trash cans and essentially. Move things around that needed to be moved around. Circulate items such as toilet paper and. Soap and whatnot and for the childcare assistant I would help children after daycare for my school.,sno,3
 I've had some experience with Dragon  which is essentially a. Voice to text conversion software that allows people to talk into the microphone and puts the processes the words essentially. I've had some good. Some good experience with it and I think I could be very helpful to the organization.,sno,3
 I would say that my skills are pretty basic. For the most part  but I think they are pretty exceptional. Not exactly advanced per se  but. Um? I could still learn from a bit more.,so,3
 I've been using word processing software for approximately maybe six years now. I'd say. About six years.,sno,3
 I haven't exactly used much Apple software when it comes to typing. I've only really been using Windows and word. But that's basically it.,sno,3
 I'm I've been using word for probably about 12 years now. I used to work on the computer a lot when I was a child and. The word processing unit has shown great capability towards work environment.,sno,3
Uh.,ack,3
Define spreadsheet.,sno,3
 If I had to answer that  it would probably be around maybe three or four years since I started college.,sno,3
 I suppose working with spreadsheets for about 15 hours would. Benefit my schedule.,y,3
 I helped. Other people in college with an assignment and essentially. I think I did a pretty good job. It was a team bonding thing. And. I'd say that I did a pretty good job at it. Not  I don't mean to gosh  but.,sno,3
 Most enjoyed it in school. Well  that's a difficult question because there's a lot of areas in school that I find interesting. History was one of my big ones. I'd also have to say that literature and grammar was important to me. Spelling and whatnot reading. Um? I was not very good at math. Math is one of my unfortunate flaws. I'm not very good at math. But everything else I seem to be pretty much OK with.,sno,3
 Um? ,ack,3
 Yeah  I again  I'm not very good at math. ,y-d,3
But I don't know.,dno,3
I guess there are some interesting things about it that help me to understand.,dno,3
More about life situations  I suppose,dno,3
 In most of my classes  surprisingly  I got A's and B's all but in the math section in the math section I had. Uh. These at the most. I was never really good at it  but I got through somehow.,sno,3
 I was in homec for awhile and it was pretty interesting. Um? Some other classes may include taking German. I took German for a little while. It didn't really last long  but. It helped some. I do know some.,sno,3
 I'd say my greatest personal attribute would be helpfulness and maybe kindness. I always try to be as kind as I can to other people to help them get what they need. But I'm also persistent in trying to pursue. Um? What it is that I want out of a job? And I can tell this would be a great thing to put my strengths towards.,sno,3
 Well. For one thing  my people skills sometimes aren't as great as I'd like them to be  and I think that maybe through this I could experience. Um? More. Openness about my condition and maybe perhaps find. I don't know  just something. Just hopefully this. Job if I do get it will be. Beneficial towards my situation.,so,3
 I'd say. I'm doing. Alright  so far in this interview. I. Probably could be better. But I think that I've done a pretty good job so far.,so,3
 Um? Let's see. Definitely not Superman  that one's taken. Um? That's a good question  actually. I don't know what my name would be as a superhero. Uh. For superpower though  I'd guess maybe time travel. That would be a pretty cool power to have. Go back in time and fix things before they happen. Um? And my arch nemesis is. Algebra man.,sno,3
 Best advice from a mentor that I've ever received. That's also really. Really big question. Um? 46 times stand up when it fall 7 times stand up. Eight was probably one of the best. Words of advice that I've received before.,sno,3
 It tells me to keep pushing forward despite adversity and despite difficulty  and I think that. Applying for a job when you have Aspergers syndrome  it can be difficult at times  so it's best to. Best to. Push forward anyway. Despite the uncomfortable  the feeling of discomfort that you might have.,sno,3
 My ideal work environment is relaxed and laid back  but also. I'd say. Laid back but at the same time also nurturing and nurturing environment. When and also understanding environment. Would probably be more beneficial towards someone like me.,sno,3
 I had to make a difficult decision. I think when I was working as a childcare assistant. I had to. It was a really rushed decision  but a child was in need of. Assistance after they had. Um? Yeah  I don't think I want to go through with the rest of that.,so,3
 Um? I did get into. I did have to get out of my comfort zone this one time and. Sometimes it can be overwhelming  but sometimes it needs to be done to see how much. What my limit is in a work environment? Um? No stories come to mind at the moment  but. I'd have to say that I have been to that place before. And it's not an easy Rd to go down on when you have Aspergers.,sno,3
 Try to correct it immediately. Be honest and assertive. But also understanding that we all make mistakes.,sno,3
 Um? I suppose there was this one time where I had to work with another student. Who? I guess we didn't see eye to eye exactly on everything  so I was stuck mostly with the work. I got through it. But it was pretty stressful. I just made sure that I told them exactly what was going on and made sure that they. Knew exactly what? My plans were. For this assignment  and then just told them straight up. What needed to happen?,sno,3
 I think I remember they switched programs this one time in another class that I took. And it was difficult getting used to  so I had to. Learn the thing. Learn the. The. I had to learn the program very quickly. And. It wasn't something that was exactly used to because I'm used to Windows  but. We had to adapt  and so I did.,so,3
 I think. A diverse group. I had to work with a diverse group in. I think the first college class that I ever went to. It was interesting to say the least  but at the same time it was also kind of difficult because we weren't on the same page with each other. Um? But I worked around it and got through it.,so,3
 Yes I do. I don't exactly have a. Well  it's more of a permit actually. Um? But I guess legally  you could say that I do have a drivers license. It's more of a permit though.,y-d,3
 What exactly? ,query,3

 My ideal work environment is somewhere. Well  I can succeed while still being around other people and. Well  I can focus without being nervous.,sno,9
 Or one time? In when I was at Cracker Barrel as a dishwasher  I had to. Decide. Otherwise  I would stand up to one of my coworkers who wasn't being very respectable of me  so that was difficult.,sno,9
 I was out of my comfort zone when I had to lead a campus tour. Of that North campus at Michigan? Because I wasn't really sure what to say and I handled it just by talking about all of the buildings we were passing by and just relaxing.,sno,9
 I would respectfully make sure that the person who you're talking to has the correct revenue man Blue. I would say wait  Are you sure that was the correct Ave number? I thought it was. This other number.,sno,9
 Yes  in my chem E 2 three class we were doing a project we will. Researching a design process and one of my team members was kind of complaining about how hard everything was and how she. Didn't know what she was doing an I just helped to encourage her to say you can. You can do it.,y-d,9
 I had to manage change when I went from high school to college because when you go from high school to college  you living in a dorm and you not at home anymore and the academics get more difficult and there's more pressure and I handled it just by trying hood and making sure I I was balanced and studied a lot. But at the same time felt found time for self care.,sno,9
 I work with a diverse group in my classes  like for example my chemical engineering class with I work with. People from lots of different backgrounds and that that helps. So we have more. Ideas 'cause they get? People have different ideas when they come from different backgrounds.,sno,9
 Yes  it was successful because we not only got the project done  but we did a good job presenting an one of the reasons was because we worked hard. Is another reason is because. Everyone had different ideas.,y-d,9

 Don't give up. It always gets better in the end  and if you don't get better then it's not the end.,sno,11
 I'm I do. It's like LAX  relax. But it's also like work intensive where there's a lot of work  but it didn't feel like it was a lot of work. Friendly coworkers is also a huge plus.,sno,11
 I. I'm sorry  I can't really think of any difficult decisions I have to make over the top of my head.,fa,11
 Probably at school. Because. I want to teach always tries to make me do like. Projects other people rather be alone. 'cause 'cause I can't rely on anyone. So what I do I just. I just suck it up.,sno,11
 I would say ma'am. I think you misread the document. 'cause here the real numbers yeah.,sno,11
 Add a team member who didn't really do any work or like he was being a little lazy  so I just went up to him. I just gave him straight OK. You know  kind of help  so if you don't want to.

 Um  no. ,n,12
 My name is {personName}.,sno,15
 That sounds great  thanks.,sno,15
 I have some prior work experience. I've done internships that helped me prepare for this work experience and I think they've been good and beneficial  but that's about the extent of my work experience so far.,sno,15
 So what I've done before is  it was in an office setting and kind of sort of what I had to do was just. Organizational stuff getting you select out. His office things works and it was. It was the same type of stuff as this. Learn stuff works too. That's fun. I think it's helpful.,sno,15
 Yes  I've been using Microsoft Word as well as Google sheets.,y-d,15
 I'd say I'd rate it pretty well.,so,15
 I'm not like amazing superstar  but I can do it fine at Sam. Pretty proficient in most of the. The things that it does.,sno,15
 I've been using it for several years. Think mercy since like. I had to start writing papers  think middle school times. I've been using it since then and I haven't really stopped. Zach is doing similar stuff with me.,sno,15
 I guess I have used. Microsoft XLS well as the Google program think that indeed we will sheets the other ones. I haven't. Not as much as I have with word processors  but I had that experience.,sno,15
 I'd say I'm pretty proficient  I know how they work  sort of  but I'm not proficient with that same word.,sno,15
 I think I've been using that for at least five years  but pretty infrequently.,sno,15
 Um  from my prior work experience  I used to spend probably. Maybe a solid like 10 hours a week doing that. That wasn't online did though I did several things.,sno,15
 Yeah  I can do that.,y,15
so one,sno,15
 Um  the project that I did was. Filling out peoples names and reaching out to people for a fund raising event for this nonprofit that worked for anyways. Just entering a bunch of names into there and organizing it based on address phone. Like I respect if they are all of that stuff and it was  it was pretty time consuming  but I'd say it was worth it.,sno,15
 I think I enjoyed probably history mentioned school or music  even though I didn't have music. Mr. Time  I think my base subject that I enjoyed most made in history from enemies. Humanities.,sno,15
 I enjoy mostly just learning about different things that have happened in different lessons that we can take away from history. What we can learn. History I'm enjoying learning to that as well as just facts and interesting tidbits.,sno,15
 Generally I got good grades like mostly Asian bees. I think my high school experience. I got about 3.5 GPA.,sno,15
 I did a few sports in school.,sno,15
 I think my greatest personal attribute is my willingness  my commitment. To get a job done. As well as loyalty and humility  I will take whatever does. So like do something for a certain objective. And I usually try not to make a big deal out of things.,so,15
 I think maybe sometimes my work ethic isn't quite as good. I think time management is something I've always struggled with. In something that I would like to learn and probably need to learn to get better at.,so,15

I really feel like I shouldn't have to rush into everything in order to enjoy myself and eventually everything will workout and I'll be fine.,sno,15
